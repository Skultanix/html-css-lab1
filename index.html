    <h3>Why Golden Retriever Puppies are the Cutest Puppies</h3>
    <h5>By Caleb Ricks</h5>
</div>
<h4>Intro</h4>
    <div class="a">
    <p>     Unless you are a heartless monster, blind, or have sufferred a sever head injury, or some combination of the three, there is no denying that puppies are cute. 
        But what exactly does that mean? Further more, if all puppies are cute, then why would golden retriever puppies come out on top?
    </p>
</div>
    <h4>What is Cute?</h4>
    <div class="a">
    <p>     Before I delve too far into my argument, I think it prudent to define terms. 
        Oxford dictionary defines cute as, “attractive in a pretty or endearing way” and defines endearing as, “inspiring love or affection”. 
        For our purposes, in order for something to be cute it needs to be attractive in a such a way that it inspires affection. 
        For most mammals this happens when they are confronted by a juvenile animal expressing the typical juvenile traits: proportionally larger forehead, eyes and cranium, reduced overall size and smaller mouth and nose. 
        All puppies have this, what sets golden retrievers apart? 
    </p>
</div>
    <h4>Golden Coats and Contrast</h4>
    <div class="a">
    <p>     Golden retrievers are known for their golden coat which ranges from nearly white to a rich auburn color.
         They also tend to have brown eyes and black noses, paw pads, lips, and claws. 
         Golden retrievers’ defining feature, their coat contrasts directly with their other features, drawing visual emphasis on those features. 
         When you see a golden retriever puppy, you see an animal with the typically endearing juvenile traits and they’re all emphasized. 
         There is simply no ignoring that little golden ball of fur with its big brown eyes tiny little nose and mouth.
    </p>

    <h4>Attractiveness Over Time</h4>

        />
    <p>     In addition to favorable coloring, golden retrievers also age very well, meaning that not only is the puppy cute, but it becomes an attractive dog as well.
         Golden retrievers are large, elegant looking dogs with sweet, friendly temperaments, with the only drawback being a profuse amount of shedding.
          When you look at a golden retriever puppy, you can see its present cuteness and the potential that will be manifest as an adult.
    </p>
</div>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <div class="a">
    <p>     In short, the reason that golden retriever puppies are the cutest puppies is because of their optimally presented cute features in addition to their potential of becoming attractive adult dogs in terms of appearance and temperament.
